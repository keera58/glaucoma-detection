# glaucoma-detection

Glaucoma is a complex disease in which damage to the optic nerve leads to progressive, irreversible vision loss. It is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, according to the World Health Organization. From babies to senior citizens, everyone is at risk for glaucoma, especially people who have a family history of glaucoma. With medication and/or surgery, it is possible to halt further loss of vision. Diagnosis is the first step to preserving your vision. Because revitalization of the degenerated nerve fibers of the optic nerve is impossible, early detection of the disease is essential. Since the problem is not limited to a certain group of people, it is difficult for ophthalmologists to study the retinal fundus images of all their patients with accuracy. 

Through this project, we aim to use Image Processing algorithms and techniques to enhance the images of retinal fundus, so that it makes the job of the ophthalmologists easier to diagnose if the patient has glaucoma or not.

We will be processing images using image processing operations such as Image Acquisition, Enhancement, Restoration, Morphological processing, Feature Extraction, Segmentation, Pattern recognition, Classification, Projection and Multi-scale signal analysis. 

The project encompasses the following:
1. Analyse the optic head region for glaucoma detection. 
2. An Adaptive thresholding technique which is used to segment the optic disc and cup. 
3. CDR, NRR and blood vessels are obtained as the features of retinal image. 
4. Analyze the size of the CDR of the sample images to classify if the patient is diagnosed with glaucoma
